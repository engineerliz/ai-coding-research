## Summary

Marc Lou walks through the AI stack he uses to spin up SaaS experiments: Cursor for inline instructions, plan-mode chat, Composer, and the design surface; MCP-powered browser hooks so Cursor can ingest console and network logs; and prefab codebases like ShipFast or Lovable to keep context consistent. He argues that naming conventions, reusable boilerplates, and clearly scoped prompts give Cursor enough grounding to rewrite back-end, front-end, and design layers in minutes while he stays in reviewer mode. The second half shows him delegating multi-file edits to Composer, piping prototypes into Lovable for UI polish, and using the 80/20 rule (AI drafts, human QA) to keep velocity without skipping manual review. He closes by urging solo founders to ship the marketing site, data model, and onboarding flow in one Cursor session so they can validate demand before overbuilding.

## Comment Analysis

### Common Themes

Filtered commenters mostly swap Cursor-specific implementation tips: they ask whether Composer or Claude access is bundled, how browser MCP logging works, and which shortcuts consume requests, underscoring the need to budget tokens carefully. Others compare Cursor to Windsurf or note that relying on LLMs alone ships average or even insecure code, so ShipFast-like accelerators still require human review. A smaller cohort celebrates how Cursor plus ShipFast makes prototyping fun again when paired with well-written rules.

**Repeating themes:** Cursor pricing/bundled models, MCP/browser integrations, Windsurf vs. Cursor comparisons, workflow shortcuts and rules, LLM risk management.

**Criticisms:**
- LLMs and ShipFast are accused of producing “average” or insecure code without seasoned engineers in the loop.
- Creators worry about hidden costs, asking whether Composer agents or Claude API usage eat into Cursor quotas.
- Windsurf is cited as a cheaper, better alternative for similar assistant features.

**Praise:**
- Cursor + ShipFast is credited with enabling 25-minute SaaS prototypes that feel fun again.
- Viewers appreciate Marc publishing his Cursor rules and MCP integrations so they can replicate the setup.
- MCP-based console capture is seen as a potential time saver if Cursor can ingest logs automatically.

| Cursor + Shipfast is my new go to for building something. I made a little prototype of a SaaS with a friend in 25 minutes the other week! Best of all, it made it fun | 03/15/2025 | 5 👍 |
| You are a shovel salesman that sells shovels to naive developers, who think that coding with just AI is the future. Let me break your bubble: LLMs are trained on huge public datasets from the internet and will therefore output the most average code it was trained on. LLMs lack nuance, context and insights that you only get after coding in a real production-grade codebase for at least a couple of years.  No wonder your ShipFast repo got pwned a while ago. Did AI not warn you about potential security issues? I doubt it will do it for your current and future projects. | 03/15/2025 | 3 👍 |
| Hey Marc, could you please tell us more about the "browser MCP so Cursor can get the console & network logs". This would save so much time. | 03/15/2025 | 1 👍 |
| Is Composer agent included with the Cursor subscription? | 05/15/2025 | 0 👍 |
| Nice concrete steps and tips! Really also appreciate you sharing your cursor rules! 🙏 | 04/15/2025 | 0 👍 |
| the the cursor instructions what does this relate to? "Avoid for data fetching or state management." | 03/15/2025 | 0 👍 |
| Do you use any MCP? Have you seen Windsurf Preview? | 03/15/2025 | 0 👍 |
| Nice video and nice stack. Do you need to buy Claude Ai to be able to use it in cursor? Or is it included into Cursor pricing? | 03/15/2025 | 0 👍 |
| All models that cursor have, are included into cursor pricing | 03/15/2025 | 0 👍 |
| @pedrogbarretto  Thanks. As I want to use only Claude AI, I am hesitating between buying Cursor Pro or Claude Pro API. Let's imagine I use a Claude API key, is Cursor AI limiting the number of request I can do with my Claude API key? | 03/15/2025 | 0 👍 |
| Does CMD + K -> enter consume a cursor request? | 03/15/2025 | 0 👍 |
| He uses Cursor. But Windsurf is better and cheaper | 03/15/2025 | 0 👍 |
