## Summary

Riley Brown and vibecode cofounder Kehan Zhang deliver a two-and-a-half-hour Cursor 2.0 bootcamp that walks complete beginners from installation through shipping a hosted meme-generator app. They unpack the IDE’s Claude-backed chat, plan mode, composer, and @workspace referencing while repeatedly swapping between guided prompts and manual edits so viewers understand when to trust Cursor versus taking control. The pair finish by comparing Cursor’s “vibe coding” ergonomics with rivals like V0, Lovable, and Replit plus tactics for continuing into desktop and mobile builds.

## Comment Analysis

### Common Themes

Commenters keep asking for an equally detailed Claude Code walkthrough, share personal wins building production features in Cursor, and debate whether non-developers can safely rely on AI assistants without fundamentals. Many contrast Cursor with other vibe coding tools (Claude Code, Warp, VS Code, ChatGPT, Lovable) while voicing mixed feelings about $200/month pricing and recent crashes. Enthusiasm remains high for Cursor’s speed and accessibility even as skeptics warn about LLM hallucinations and maintenance debt.

**Repeating themes:** demand for Claude Code counterpart, Cursor vs competitor comparisons (Warp, VS Code, ChatGPT builds), pricing and credit fatigue, stability concerns on new releases, inspiration for non-developers shipping fast

**Criticisms:**
- $200/month Cursor plans feel overpriced for beginners and incentivize upsells instead of fundamentals.
- Repeated crashes after every update erode trust in Cursor’s stability.
- Skeptics argue Codex/Cursor/Claude generate bloated code that novices cannot debug without real engineering skills.

**Praise:**
- Several viewers shipped full video-calling or embedded projects in Cursor within days despite limited coding experience.
- Tutorials like this re-energize lapsed subscribers who reinstall Cursor or upgrade to Ultra plans.
- Cursor’s interface and prompt-first workflows make serious builds feel achievable for non-technical founders.

| Please bring a detailed one on Claude Code as well just like this one ❤ | 11/10/2025 | 21 👍, 3 💬 |
| Bt the way the next video will be just like this one... except it will be on Claude Code! Make sure to subscribe for that. <br>Kehan built the Claude Code integration in the Vibecode App which builds mobile apps. That can be tried here: https://www.vibecodeapp.com/ | 11/10/2025 | 12 👍, 1 💬 |
| HOW MUCH ARE YOU BEING PAID TO SHILL THIS FALSEHOOD. This is a lie, from liars. Tell them about the $200 per month fee they will pay just to use a system that will fail them. And if you don't already know how to code, how are you ever going to know, find, or fix any problems with the application? You won't, you will pay to have the computer fix its mistake. Let's now get into bloat, versioning, or full application overview. Codex, Cursor, and Claude are all frauds. Not to mention the only way to train an LLM is with code, and the only code available online is typically bad code with one single true answer, or you have to put bits and pieces together to get it to work. Stack Overflow has millions of wrong answers, and they trained your LLM on every one of them.<br><br>LLM != AI<br>LLM != Good code | 11/10/2025 | 2 👍, 8 💬 |
| I made my first video calling app with cursor in 4 days and i didnt know a word of coding🥳🥳🥳 | 11/11/2025 | 0 👍, 3 💬 |
| I'm intrigued that you're talking about Cursor, and mentioning Cursor competitors, without mentioning Claude Code. | 11/10/2025 | 0 👍, 2 💬 |
| 5:20 I’ve used cursor for embedded systems (firmware development for a hardware project) and it’s been fantastic | 11/11/2025 | 1 👍, 0 💬 |
| Bro are you seriously from an non technical background..I didnt knew that..I though you were a developer or something and already has coding experience..as you know these kind of tools like cursor, Claude code pretty well and use them effortlessly..maybe I can too..earlier I thought it would be rocket science and I have to write codes and all those..but mostly its prompting  and telling it what to build along with learning some commands and context engineering. cursor has already made the interface very less technical and i think in future updates..it will be even more easier for non technical folks to use these powerful tools..am i right ?? | 11/11/2025 | 1 👍, 0 💬 |
| I’ve done a ton of Claude code videos. | 11/10/2025 | 1 👍, 0 💬 |
| best...cursor is easy to use..make on cluade code | 11/11/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
| Big Thank you to both of you guys! You guys got me to redownload cursor again xD if there is any ref link please let me know I am just about to jump into the ultra plan again ! <br>btw looking forward to the Claude code video <3 | 11/14/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
| Cursor === VSCode with the soul of God. | 11/14/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
| another great video guys - would love to see a video on how you can take an existing project (lets say you created an app in chatGPT) and you can bring it into Cursor, or Claude and add enhancements and mods to your project. | 11/12/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
| How bout vs. Warp | 11/11/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
| Thank you so much for this video, Riley. If I could just ask for a favour of a similar one like this, but with Claude Code, please. You're the best!! | 11/11/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
| I would to see this for VS Code which I think is better then Cursor! | 11/11/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
| I loved it , please do a similar video for Claude Code | 11/11/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
| Currently cursor crashes quite often for me on the latest updates. Every single time there was an update. It seems to crash... It asked to update again. I have no idea why. | 11/10/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
| Hey Riley, if you got cursor pro for a year, Share it forward. Would like to keep building. Ran out credit | 11/10/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
| While they both can be used for 'vibe coding', I think they're two totally different products.  Personally I prefer when the video is on one product rather than jumping around and showing the differences in each product, unless it's a comparison video.  This video is specific to building an app in cursor, and he'll have a different video on building an app in claude code,   I think the way they did this video where it's just walking through one product is perfect. | 11/10/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
| @rileybrownai  can't wait for the Claude Code tutorial. Rough idea when that might be coming out? | 11/14/2025 | 0 👍, 0 💬 |
