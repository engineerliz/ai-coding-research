## Summary

Chris Ashby demonstrates a three-prompt Cursor 2.0 workflow that turns a curated Dribbble screenshot into a reusable design system. Prompt one has GPT-5 analyze the reference image and author a `design.json` style brief, prompt two asks Claude Sonnet 4.5 to scaffold a React + Vite + Tailwind gallery of every component, and prompt three codifies the look-and-feel in `design/design-system.json` so future AI agents inherit the same language. He repeatedly runs the project locally, inspects hover states, and tweaks palette/spacing until Cursor’s agents and any follow-on workflows can regenerate production-ready UI without falling back to generic gradients.

## Comment Analysis

### Common Themes

Viewers are captivated by the “three prompt” clarity yet keep sanity-checking whether Cursor brings enough value over VS Code, v0, Lovable, or other AI builders, especially when subscriptions pile up. Pricing and access come up often—people want Cursor’s agents but resort to Copilot or Gemini when budgets are tight, and they want to see Cursor itself executing more of the steps shown on screen. Others trade tips: seed prompts that pair GPT‑5 with Sonnet 4.5, export Tailwind-ready assets from Figma plugins, and zoom in on Dribbble shots so LLMs have pixel-sharp guidance, underscoring how design fidelity lives or dies on the data you hand your assistant.

**Repeating themes:** Cursor vs. VS Code/Copilot trade-offs, v0 or Lovable as alternative UI generators, affordability of Cursor subscriptions, desire for Cursor-focused execution footage, pairing multiple AI models per prompt, and sourcing cleaner design references for LLMs.

**Criticisms:** Cursor pricing locks out some builders; several commenters say the video still leans on manual setup instead of showing Cursor running the plans; others note LLMs stumble on the new Tailwind 4 syntax without heavy prompt scaffolding.

**Praise:** The three-prompt recipe gives designers-turned-builders a concrete checklist, encourages mixing GPT‑5, Sonnet, and Cursor for division of labor, and highlights practical tricks (Figma exports, Dribbble zooming) that immediately level up AI-generated UI fidelity.

| Can I do this on vscode instead of cursor? | 2025-11-14 | 2 👍 |
| There was a big change in the integration of TW4 from the previous version and LLMs are sometimes lost in the initial setup. But just creating a good plan of implementation, with pointing to proper Tailwind 4 documentation solves the issue. Smaller/older models might struggle with this though. | 2025-11-14 | 2 👍 |
| Can you explain why not use v0 to do the same job ? | 2025-11-13 | 2 👍 |
| i want to use cursor 😭 but i can't afford it | 2025-11-13 | 2 👍 |
| More cursor builds ❤ | 2025-11-14 | 1 👍 |
| Great content. Very useful to me. Thanks. As a feedback: It would have been great to see how cursor is using this. | 2025-11-13 | 1 👍 |
| Thanks for sharing. This is awesome. Vscode + GitHub copilot license is cheaper than cursor for anyone not wanting to spend on cursor subscription. | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| 1: gpt5 [share screenshot]: Deeply analyse the design of the attached screenshot to create a design.json file in this project that describes the style and design of every UI component needed in a design system at a high level like a creative director. Capture high level guidelines for structure, spacing, fonts, colours, design style and design principles so I can use this file as the design guidelines for my app. The goal with this file is to instruct AI to be able to replicate this look easily in this project.  2: sonnet 4.5 [create the ui components]: Let's create a simple screen that contains every UI component that would exist in a design system on a mock dashboard, following the design style outlined in design.json. Build this as a Vite app using react and translate all styling into tailwind v3. Then run this locally.  3: gpt5 [guidelines for ai to follow]: In this project create a folder named 'design' and create a design-system.json file in this folder that outlines the exact styling for all components and styles in this app along with high level design guidelines. The goal with the file is to create a comprehensive guide for AI to follow when building new features in this app. | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| @buildgreatproducts yeah that was my understanding, I find v0 for some reason is exceptionally better at designing complex UIs | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
| I'd recommend searching for a Figma plugin that exports the Tailwind implementation or even React code, if You write in React, that you can just give to Cursor/Claude Code to implement around it. Also I recommend Lovart and Google Stitch for designs. | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| Really enjoyed this tut, super smart way to go about it! I'm a product designer trying to get into coding with these tools and having more control over the UI is what I'm looking for tbh as AI UI is still so bad and this helps a lot! I also really like how v0 and Lovable has visual edits. I've been thinking about syncing these projects through Github so I can tweak visually in those tools but then use Cursor mostly for the AI coding itself. Do you think this is overkill and I'm over complicating things? | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
| Quick tip that someone might find useful:  When browsing Dribbble and you find a design you really like, don’t just download or screenshot it right away. Instead, click on the design to open it, then click on the image itself. Your cursor will turn into a plus icon, click again to zoom in further.  Doing this actually loads a higher-quality version of the image. The first one you see is often a compressed preview, but zooming in gives you the sharper, original version — much better for clarity and might generate better design from the LLMs | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
