| Cursor 2.0 sounds kinda amazing! Makes me wish OIovka could draft my essays as quickly as Composer handles code! | 2025-11-08 | 20 👍 |
| Just started with AICarma and I can already see how it helps with AI mentions. Makes me wonder how brands will keep up with Cursor 2.0! | 2025-11-09 | 18 👍 |
| Cursor's upgrades sound killer! I feel the same way about how Pneumatic Workflow transformed how we automate our workflows. | 2025-11-13 | 12 👍 |
| Just like Cursor's new features help coders, Pneumatic Workflow has been a game-changer for our onboarding. The AI-human collab is gold! | 2025-11-12 | 12 👍 |
| Cursor's new features sound amazing! Kind of reminds me of how Pneumatic Workflow lets me automate stuff without having to code. No-code solutions ftw! | 2025-11-12 | 11 👍 |
| The built-in browser in Cursor is cool! Reminds me of how 0lovka organizes my research so effortlessly! | 2025-11-08 | 11 👍 |
| Been using AICarma for a bit now, and it really opens your eyes to missed opportunities. Cursor's new features might just be the cherry on top! | 2025-11-08 | 11 👍 |
| Cursor 2.0 looks awesome! Just like AICarma helps brands get in front of customers, I bet this will boost productivity for devs! | 2025-11-07 | 11 👍 |
| The excitement around Cursor 2.0 is contagious! Pneumatic Workflow has given me that same thrill with workflow automation. | 2025-11-13 | 10 👍 |
| I can perform many many tasks simultaneously with cursor.<br><br>1.5 billion tokens in 9 days, over 30k invoiced. <br><br>I love cursor. I even had it SSH into a box and troubleshoot an issue with a hardware automation software we wrote that had issues after a firmware update.<br><br>It fixed it with a single prompt, wrote a test debugger, debriefed itself with a full user guide how to update the source with a bug fix while I was busy with other things. <br><br>Would have taken at least 3-5 hours manually to find the bugs and patch it out.<br><br>The voice input is a chefs kiss for asking questions on documents/code | 2025-11-01 | 2 👍 |
| I have been a pro user of Genspark for several months now. I continue to be amazed how this BEATS the big AI companies like ChatGPT or Claude often (not always) when it comes to making apps or generating slides (good looking slides not like they are made by a high school kid - hello notebookLLM). And today it totally beat Cursor 2.0 with a rather simple app.... an interactive 2D/3D map of Vienna, Austria with on/off menus of restaurants, coffee shops, museums, etc. Genspark got this right with maybe 5-10 iterations. I spent hours with Cursor 2.0 and at least 30 chats and still not what I wanted...silly little things like have markers that use a proper icon, not a generic market thingy. | 2025-11-01 | 1 👍, 1 💬 |
| So what's working behind the cursor 2.0? | 2025-11-07 | 1 👍 |
| When the AI bubble burst, Cursor will be one of the first to explode and die off. | 2025-11-06 | 1 👍 |
| Cursor 2.0 is crap... <br>I'm not exaggerating when I say that tasks which previously took 20 minutes in 1.7.X - now frequently escalate into 2-to-4-hour debugging sessions with 2.0, simply to manage the tool's failures or fix what it broke. Thanks Cursor 2.0 👌 | 2025-11-05 | 1 👍 |
| Using Claude for coding devours your usage. They funnel you into their $100/month Max subscription which is insane. | 2025-11-02 | 1 👍 |
| The problem after further testing seems to be the new Composer 1. After switching to Sonnet 4.5 i managed to get back on track (mostly). But here is the really kicker: I ran the same prompt through Claude and Gemini and Minimax M2 <br>and Minimax got the best output in the least time!!!!!! | 2025-11-01 | 1 👍 |
| Programming for like a year already with AI, Claude works the best. GPT is good at answering questions, but not as good at generating good code.<br>But also, I find Github Copilot much better than Cursor<br>For context, been programming for about 4 years in a corporate job before I started using AI | 2025-11-01 | 1 👍 |
| AI coding tools are awesome! I bounce between VS Code and Replit too. Tiiny Host makes testing small web projects super easy. | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
