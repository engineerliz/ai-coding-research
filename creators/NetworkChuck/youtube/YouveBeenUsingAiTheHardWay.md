| Not gonna lie, the hardest part about using AI for work isn’t learning prompts — it’s paying for 10+ tools just to get basic stuff done. I used to have ChatGPT Plus, Claude, Gemini, and a few random generators on top of that. Then I found Omnely, which basically merges everything (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, even Sora and Veo) under one roof. Cheaper and cleaner setup. | 2025-11-14 | 38 👍 |
| Claude pro locks me out for 5 hrs at a time and has a weekly lockout? | 2025-11-11 | 1 👍 |
| Heyy Chuck, how about aider? could it also be used? it is open source, free and allows multiple ai models to be used, local and cloud based. | 2025-11-01 | 1 👍 |
| @An0nAce1  your gpu doesn’t matter. Aider would work on a crappy laptop. | 2025-11-01 | 1 👍 |
| You didn't talk about extensions in gemini-cli? | 2025-11-01 | 1 👍 |
| i care a lot, and i use gemini | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| Thanks for your helpful video. <br>Openai deprecated the codex. Their openai-cli does not work as expected. I tried to use aider to access gpt api key which is ok. I will like to know if you have any work around or suggestion? | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| Another great video @NetworkChuck. You inspired me to get started in coding and now I am starting to think about applying for jobs. I have been using ClaudeCode for a while now and it rocks!! | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| How do the agents you create compare to using Claude Code Skills? | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| I love Gemini CLI. Thanks for making me aware of this!<br>I can't agree that it's 10x faster. At least not for normal questions. But I have switched to CLI now! Much more fun. (They even listened when I reported a bug!) | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| I love how people focus on prompt hacks when the real hack is just consolidating your tools. Once I moved everything to Omnely (it lets you switch between models like GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, etc.), my productivity actually doubled. | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| This video hits hard. I was 100% that guy juggling ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini tabs, thinking I was being productive. Turns out I was just paying five bills to do the same thing. Omnely simplified my entire stack. Never going back. | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| I like claude's best-of-both-worlds vs code extention that combines the webui style with the console functionality. | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| I am an active user of Perplexity and ChatGPT... Thought I could use them like you (like a pro), but faced harsh reality.<br><br>Any suggestions you have how to setup those models? | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| As a junior Developer this video was really helpful. I like to use gemini alot. Idk i could use it in my terminal. It saves me so much time! thanks! | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| I don't know if it's something i did wrong, but when i ask Gemini CLI something, it just spits out "As a software engineering CLI agent, I'm not equipped to give you instructions on how to make the<br>  best cup of coffee in the world. My expertise is in code and software development.<br><br>  If you have a software engineering task, I'd be happy to help." | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
| Am I crazy for never maxing out the context of the free tier of ChatGPT? Or at least not noticing any hallucinations except for some prompts. | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
| I was loving claude and was having issues with it limiting me and found my way here. From what I have seen this is still interacting with claude over the internet its not running anything local, other than saving/reading files, correct? So I shoudl be able to setup a headless server with linux and do the same thing just connecting to it with ssh. Setup once and use with any pc on my network sounds awesome but are there hardware issue. The box I would do it with is not super powerful and wouldn't be able to handle much AI processing on its own. | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
| In don't think you're supposed to sudo install gemini, just because the ordinary install failed... | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
| Can I do the same things with GitHub Copilot CLI?? | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
