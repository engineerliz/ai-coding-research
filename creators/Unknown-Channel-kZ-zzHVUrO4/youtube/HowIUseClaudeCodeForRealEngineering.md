| I feel like people don't quite understand the concept of 'leveraging' AI for coding. You're not relying on it entirely—you still need to debug & tweak but if you understand what AI is useful for then it can dramatically boost your productivity.<br><br>For me it's really all about understanding how to have an active, ongoing live-debugging session with it—asking it the right questions, utilizing screenshots, reverting back, there's quite a few techniques, but I actually think it makes coding a lot more entertaining, and it also helps explain to me what my knowledge gaps are without having to scour the depths of the internet for hyper specific technical information.<br><br>Personally, I use two AI programs at once: Claude browser for basic coding & version control (with manual editing in Visual Studio which I then upload back into Claude), and then Copilot quite literally as if it were a copilot sort of helping me out on the side with any questions I might have while staying separate from Claude's work area. | 2025-11-01 | 27 👍, 4 💬 |
| have literally the same situation. A year ago i changed the company and started to heavily using AI on different levels like just in-line autocompletion(cursor tab) and cursor chat(claude). With time i started forgetting how to write very basic things, syntax, started to have a lot of mistakes and comments on my PRs and felt insecure in what i'm doing. Turning off cursor tab completely and using chat only in cases where i really need it helped me a lot. I enourage everyone to write code by yourself and use AI only in cases where you are like 80% sure it's going to do what you want and it won't take you much time fxing it's mistakes | 2025-11-01 | 19 👍 |
| I have a rule that make Claude code always spawn subagent task when it goes to implementation which is doing well to conserve the main process context window. The main process can now keep track of the high level execution phases without the hassle of loading back context from GH or files. | 2025-11-01 | 13 👍, 6 💬 |
| @mattpocockuk  Look, man, with all due respect you deserve, but the scope of possibilities was aways there, for anyone that would risk it. So much that absolutely everything we may talk about was, once, a crazy idea.<br><br>I don't dislike AI. I use ChatGPT to help me with specific tasks, but that's it. IMO, abusive use of AI, especially to kick start AND finish some software, will mask an individual's lack of ability under a supposedly achievement pane. <br><br><br>I understand you're focused on helping other achieve a greater level of efficiency by teaching how to better make use of AI etc, but I can't help pointing out that, sometimes, and for me, this seems to be case, teaching how to fish is a better option, for harder it may seem, than teaching how to order a ready made meal. | 2025-11-01 | 5 👍 |
| In my opinion, Claude code is not the agent for engineers or engineering. Well, this is more of a critique of Anthropic's models. They seemed to have done some data augmentation or synthetic data generation that taught the model bizzare patterns. Occasionally their models do unthinkable things.<br><br>For example, leaving a comment that acknowledges a highly critical bug exists, but claiming its "intentional" then proceeding to justify why its good that this bug exists. I cannot fathom a human ever doing this, this behavior must of been learned from augmented or synthetic data. It doesn't make any sense. I almost think the bug existing without the comment would be preferable, as it would indicate more logically consistent output.<br><br>Then you also have Claude's classic "You're completely right, I deleted your database" bit, which is funny, but it is something that Claude actually does. <br><br>Using Claude for engineering is like trying calculate half of a number N by flipping a coin N times and counting the number of heads. Except, the law of large numbers doesn't apply and the result gets further as the code in Claude context window increases. | 2025-11-01 | 2 👍, 1 💬 |
| Fascinating. I'd still rather code myself but it is very interesting to see how this works. <br>If I look at all the stuff you have to do to bring the LLM to produce (hopefully) the right result, we are approaching 40K tech really fast. Soon nobody will understand any more what is happening in the code, we will try to bring the machines to produce the right code by uttering the right incantations and praying that the Omnissiah listens...<br>Edit: this is not critizing the video - I really meant it when I wrote that I find it fascinating! I really like your videos, and as soon as I have some time on my hand I plan to go and try out your recommendations and see for myself what Claude can do or not. <br>I only find it amusing to compare the approach to AI "programming" to 40K 😅 | 2025-11-01 | 1 👍, 2 💬 |
| I was so fed up with the cursor, so today I decided to finally subscribe to Claude Code, but it was a bit confusing and then this video showed up in my feed, what a perfect timing lol , thanks for sharing | 2025-11-01 | 2 👍 |
| Does Claude code provide any significant advantage over Cursor for the process you outlined above?  Would you be able to make a Cursor equivalent video? | 2025-11-01 | 1 👍, 1 💬 |
| I've been using Warp and Copilot to assist me in both terminal and code-related tasks. I was just wondering what are the pros and tradeoffs between them and Claude Code? | 2025-11-01 | 0 👍, 2 💬 |

| Excellent content Matt. Best explanation of real-world usage of Claude Code I've encountered. Thank you! | 2025-11-03 | 1 👍 |
| I miss the "real engineering" in this video. You do a good job in explaining the capabilities of Claude Code but (just like so many other similar videos) it is missing the serious engineering part. Letting an AI dump a ton of code without even looking at it, is unfortunately not what I was expecting when reading the titel of this video. | 2025-11-03 | 1 👍 |
| @mattpocockuk  Yep. It's actually the first on the list when you press ? for shortcuts. I use it mostly to quickly check pwd when I have too many tabs running claude... | 2025-11-01 | 1 👍 |
| "You're completely right" issues and justifying bugs comes from sycophancy, and most models suffer from it. OpenAI's GPT-4o is the WORST at this, even though it's now an old model. It was so bad people on reddit are literally romanticizing ChatGPT. It's really not just an Anthropic problem. | 2025-11-01 | 1 👍 |
| I noticed when you ran /context you did NOT have the Autocompact buffer line item. I see this in my Claude Code and it takes up about 22% of my token context size. Why is this not present in your context? | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍, 1 💬 |
| In your rules files, does the `<pr-comment-rule>` markup tag do anything special? I know that Claude proper can do something special with structured fields, but I'm not aware of a similar feature with Claude Code. | 2025-11-01 | 0 👍, 1 💬 |
| ok, but how is it better than cursor/windsurf? | 2025-11-01 | 0 👍, 1 💬 |
| @mohammadmalik9075  copilot sucks at any tasks. Its autocomplete is a joke. | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
| Hi Matt! Any chance we can see the rest of your Claude Code user memory file? Not a lot of good examples of that out there, it would also make for a great video. Cheers! | 2025-11-12 | 0 👍 |
| Matt look at ccusage:<br><br>  Script fixed to use ccusage blocks --json which tracks active session tokens. Restart Claude Code to see:<br><br>  [Sonnet] 📦 claude-helpers/main S:0 U:0 A:3 \| 🎯 142k/200k | 2025-11-10 | 0 👍 |
