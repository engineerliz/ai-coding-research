## Comment Analysis

### Common Themes

The comments read like a help desk for beginners “vibe coding” their first apps: people ask whether to pick Cursor, Codex, Claude, or Google AI Studio, how to migrate projects from Replit or App Builder, and how to avoid surprise cloud bills. There’s palpable enthusiasm for Cursor’s ownership of code and rapid UI work, yet lots of anxiety about pricing tiers, API usage, and deployment complexity, especially for older or non-traditional students. Fans repeatedly urge Corbin to produce more walkthroughs (Google-only builds, Cursor CLI, Codex integrations) to demystify the stack.

- **Repeating themes:** tool selection for newbies (Cursor vs Codex vs Claude vs Replit/Google), pricing/usage fears, deployment workflows, request for step-by-step migrations, subscription tier questions, and excitement about Cursor 2.0 pace.
- **Criticisms:** Cursor called expensive with limited free usage; some lament lacking 1-click deploy like Replit or fear misconfiguring APIs and getting charged; others worry Cursor can’t match Codex’s high-end models without integrations.
- **Praise:** Many credit Cursor with letting non-coders ship full apps, rave about ownership/control versus hosted builders, applaud its multi-agent speed, and thank the creator for making intimidating workflows feel approachable.

| should i use cursor,codex or claude code | 2025-11-10 | 3 👍, 1 💬 |
| your thoughts about Replit? I made a small web app with it and deployed it and it was pretty good. I have trouble deploying without that 1-click deployment Replit has, but I feel as replit can't make the monster products Cursor can... yet. You think replit will get to the level of Cursor, or do you think Cursor will add a 1-click deployment type of feature? | 2025-11-09 | 1 👍, 2 💬 |
| Thanks Corbin for this series. Is it possible to build this just with Google AI Studio with or without Google Firebase (+ Google Cloud to host it)? I mean just with the Google ecosystem without using Cursor or any other tools? | 2025-11-09 | 1 👍, 2 💬 |
| Je comprend pas l’anglais heureusement y’a la traduction vocal de YouTube merci à toi je suis tes vidéo et sa m’apporte bcp de valeur LOL je Conner vraiment rien au code mais je créer des site juste avec cursor et l’ai 😅 | 2025-11-09 | 2 👍 |
| @Corbin So, would you use Google or Cursor or both? I'm an absolute beginner developing my first app - at the age of 56. (Long story) using Google Studio, my problem is as I'm adding value, and adding Value, and adding Value ad infinitum I have suddenly run into trouble and it  just stops working. Because I am clueless about coding, I have no clue what is going wrong. Surely I can take the code and paste it somewhere and it will correct it. Or what... i think you do describe it in video 2, so will check, but I am thinking it would be good to know code! Your cheat sheet response will help! | 2025-11-09 | 1 👍, 1 💬 |
| Another great video mate. A silly question… how did you move this project from google app builder to Cursor? | 2025-11-09 | 1 👍, 1 💬 |
| After almost a week of me asking for a Google AI Studio to App store tutorial, I'm starting to realize maybe Cursor 2.0 to the App Store is the real value move here. <br><br>Like you said in this video, Google AI Studio is good to map out the value or idea. <br><br>But Cursor is the one to bring it to life and materialize it. Thank you for this video!!!! ⚡💯🔥 | 2025-11-09 | 0 👍, 2 💬 |
| I wonder what tier of Cursor subscription is used here. I started building (as a noob) and ran up a high usage and tapped out of the free in just two days. Trying to figure out now how to save on usage by getting smarter and using multiple tools more effectively to spread it out | 2025-11-12 | 1 👍 |
| You are right bro. Google AI studio might improve (of course it will definitely improve) however, if you want ownership and full control of your code, using Cursor or any other better AI enabled IDE will be the way to go. It's cursor today, another badass IDE might be the game changer of tomorrow. The principles Corbin is dishing out here is the most important as it will apply no matter the IDE you choose to use anyday anytime. | 2025-11-09 | 1 👍 |
| I bloody love you Corbin 🥰 I’m terrified of setting up my App incorrectly and getting a huge bill or draining my bank account. Just for us dummies pretty please could you just explain real easy, expand a little more on setting up phase how to ensure we DONT mistakenly end up being charged by the platform/cloud/google/API whatever for the customers’ workspace or generations. You did talk about it in first video a teeny weeny ickle bit but so fucking fast I just couldn’t get ya. And the api thing, how to ensure we don’t fuck up and apply our personal api to the customer level experience? It’s obvious to you but most of us can’t understand 1. WHAT we will be charged for once we create the app, whats free what ISNT?<br>2. How does the pricing system work to us the app creator?<br>3. Then we can a) ensure we charge enough for our app to cover costs based on x thousand customers and b) make sure we’re in profit and not liable for our customers usage of our app’s inbuilt ai functions (gemini, veo3, nanobsnana, claude, gpt5 etc) <br>Help! Scared. | 2025-11-12 | 0 👍, 1 💬 |
| That UI is fcking bomb bro, did you used gpt 5 codex high to make it? | 2025-11-11 | 0 👍, 1 💬 |
| How about making a video on how to integrate Claude subscription or api into cursor. As well as having the Codex api inetgrated to Cursor.. so its cheaper to use then cursor on it own. Thanks, Love the videos! | 2025-11-11 | 0 👍 |
| Gemini already has 1 Million context window | 2025-11-11 | 0 👍 |

| ❤❤❤ Corbin, you are the GUY ❤❤❤ <br>Thank you so much for all this hard work to share your golden skills - your knowledge from the years you learned from trial and error are truly timesavers for us newer to the current way of vibing… I am old-school, and haven’t coded in years, and when I did, it was only primarily front end. A lot has changed since PHP and HTML, with a little Flash thrown in for fun! :) I’ve watched many of your tutorials, and I’m still amazed that you don’t have millions of subscribers by now! Their loss :) Thanks again! <br><br>Question - I’ve been using CC on Max 20 for a couple of months, I’ve also tried Droid. I haven’t used Cursor beyond the 2 week free trial 3 months ago. I primarily use CC in Cursor terminal, plus Codex Plus in IDE there, plus a little Gemini there just to have a round out when things go really sideways on my complex saas app. I want to go all-in and get a $200 plan with Codex, or Claude Code, or Cursor (or maybe Droid, but not likely) - do you feel Cursor gives the best value for the top-tier plan? Should I just go hard and get that plus Codex to debug and troubleshoot for a couple of months of the final push to live? I’m still trying to get the best fit, and my gut says Claude Code in recent weeks isn’t it. <br><br>I value your awesome insights, thanks so much! | 2025-11-10 | 0 👍 |
| Brev started using cursor 2.0 today after using codex 5 high, it’s sik tbf, multi agent is mad | 2025-11-10 | 0 👍 |
| Can we use a lot of codex 5 high on cursor? | 2025-11-10 | 0 👍 |
| What’s the best vibe coding tool atm you think? ATM I just use codex pro | 2025-11-10 | 0 👍 |
| @Corbin_Brown ah good point about owning the code. Thats huge. I tried to make larger projects on replit with night are deployment errors, which didnt happen on Cursor 1.0. With 2.0 (and growing) its only getting easier. Last video = another one | 2025-11-10 | 0 👍 |
| Insane pace! 15 commits in a day is wild. Makes me wanna try out Cursor 2.0 too—probably pairs nicely with lightweight hosting on something like Tiiny Host for quick testing. | 2025-11-09 | 0 👍 |
