| Man, I thought I knew the rules: work hard, hustle, save every cent. But I always felt stuck. Then someone casually mentioned Hidden Codex of Wealth by Dorian Caine in a comment somewhere, and I swear—it felt like accidentally stumbling onto forbidden knowledge. It made me question every single thing I'd been taught about money, wealth, and success. Not gonna lie, I felt like I was cheating the system just by reading it. | 2025-06-15 | 68 👍, 1 💬 |
| Super good information, would be also very interesting to see an actual demonstration of your workflow with the screenshot + Magic Patterns and how you use cursor+rules+mcp. | 2025-05-15 | 27 👍, 1 💬 |
| Awesome, for me it also works to start in bolt before moving to cursor. I've found that bolt is great for the boilerplate UI Layer and I then export the code directly to Cursor and build from there. It is also helpfull to give the LLM context of your practices (eg. Atomic Design) and tech stack at the beginning, even if you already have it stated in your rules. | 2025-05-15 | 9 👍, 1 💬 |
| I totally agree with the 95% confidence prompt! Especially with advanced models like Sonnet 3.7, they often go off track and generate a bunch of workaround code without actually checking the community or the latest docs. That’s why I usually stick with the older Sonnet 3.5 and manually add more context myself. I’ll definitely give this prompt a try with the latest AI models-thanks for sharing!<br><br>By the way, I also use Supabase for my backend. I love that it can generate TypeScript types, which really helps with backend-frontend integration (though for more complex types like JSON, I still need to add another layer for better type definitions) | 2025-06-15 | 7 👍 |
| 7:12 lol, exactly my experience with cursor and cloud, and I'm like no wrf stop acting on ur own u work for me u do exactly what i say !! | 2025-05-15 | 5 👍 |
| So are u not using chats like gemini? Only cursor and chat in the cursor? Is it fast enough and has enough prompt limits? Never used cursor and wondering to try it | 2025-06-15 | 0 👍, 4 💬 |
| I would be very interested if you could make a step-by-step clip for the process you went through in this video. I tried Cursor once and I will take a look at Magic Patterns, but seeing it all in action in a longer video would be grand. | 2025-05-15 | 1 👍, 2 💬 |
| I'm curious, how much of the code do you write by yourself and how much is AI generated/auto completed?<br><br>Also, do you write bits of it first and give the AI some form of a pathway to follow along with the cursor rules or do you use AI generated code from the beginning? | 2025-05-15 | 1 👍, 2 💬 |
| Great video! I've had a similar experience. Except I'm still directly using Claude instead of Cursor. haha I'm probably one of the only ones still doing that. | 2025-05-15 | 0 👍, 3 💬 |
| I'm glad claude responds the same way when my clients ask me to make something pop. | 2025-07-15 | 2 👍 |
| My only question, how much cost to make that one app? You pay for Magic Pattern, Cursor, Supabase (maybe) so how much cost to build an app using those tools? | 2025-07-15 | 2 👍 |
| I would add that to the Cursor rules. | 2025-06-15 | 2 👍 |
| After a long chat, Cursor suggests to start a new chat for better results and it’s almost always better when I do so. What do you think? | 2025-06-15 | 2 👍 |
| @YourAverageTechBro I use copilot, any thoughts on where I should put this finalizer? | 2025-05-15 | 2 👍 |
| 6:58 The confidence 95% finalizer, cant you just add that to the rules in cursor instead of having to add it in at the end of each prompt? | 2025-06-15 | 1 👍, 1 💬 |
| I’m not sure to fully understand what you meant by connecting your supabase MCP to Cursor in the first place because you said you focus on the UI first before starting implementing the backend related logic and database design. Thanks for the high quality content ! | 2025-06-15 | 1 👍, 1 💬 |
| that guy is rapid fire !! I am french  but I could still understand. Thanks for the sharing. Now starting my journey to use the same stack supabase+cursor ai+manjaro+nextjs+tailwindcssui+whatever. | 2025-05-15 | 1 👍, 1 💬 |
| @YourAverageTechBro  I started off with VSC a year ago using Cluade for coding everything. <br><br>In the beginning I would upload all the files for my project, then text files of everything, then zips and compressed zips until it got too big. <br><br>Now I know my code well enough to give claude just what it needs. <br><br>Claude is amazing at design and coding so I never felt the need to switch.<br><br>I could switch to cursor but I'm wondering if it'll actually save me time vs just sticking to claude | 2025-05-15 | 1 👍 |
| Thanks for video, Which model do you usually use in Cursor? | 2025-06-15 | 0 👍, 1 💬 |
| Love it and get the gist.   I am going to rewatch.   Currently having a love/hate relationship with it.  Got the MCP's wired up.  Got the rules wired up.  And every now and then it forgets I want Next JS 15 and Supabase with Server Actions.  Sure, here is a client component that is great for Next JS 13.   WTF Cursor.   You treat me bad, but I love you so much. | 2025-06-15 | 0 👍, 1 💬 |
