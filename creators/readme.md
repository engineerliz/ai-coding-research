| [How I use Claude Code (+ my best tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7iT5r0Sl_Y) | [Steve (Builder.io)](https://www.youtube.com/@BuilderIO) | "As a 25+ year dev Claude Code has completely changed the way I code. I know how to create quality code, quality architectures cause I've done them like 40 times at this point. So now I just guide Claude to create exactly what I want because it can write code at rate that no developer can write code. Not even close. So I find myself as more of an experienced architect now guiding it along. I do have to occasionally step in for very complex things and fix the code for it. But it's pretty rare actually."<br><br>"Really resonates about Claude finding bugs that humans miss, it's wild how AI spots that stuff."<br><br>Criticisms: "others cite quirks like missing checkpoints, placeholder data, async bugs, and clipboard issues" |
| [Cursor 2.0 is here... 5 things you didn't know it can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIp8sFB2GGw) | [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) | "I can perform many many tasks simultaneously with cursor. 1.5 billion tokens in 9 days, over 30k invoiced. I love cursor. I even had it SSH into a box and troubleshoot an issue with a hardware automation software we wrote that had issues after a firmware update. It fixed it with a single prompt, wrote a test debugger, debriefed itself with a full user guide how to update the source with a bug fix while I was busy with other things. Would have taken at least 3-5 hours manually to find the bugs and patch it out."<br><br>"Cursor 2.0 is crap... I'm not exaggerating when I say that tasks which previously took 20 minutes in 1.7.X - now frequently escalate into 2-to-4-hour debugging sessions with 2.0, simply to manage the tool's failures or fix what it broke."<br><br>Praise: "Fans celebrate Cursor fixing bugs autonomously, massive token throughput, SSH/terminal control" |
| [How I use Claude Code for real engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ-zzHVUrO4) | [Matt Pocock](https://www.youtube.com/@mattpocockuk) | "have literally the same situation. A year ago i changed the company and started to heavily using AI on different levels like just in-line autocompletion(cursor tab) and cursor chat(claude). With time i started forgetting how to write very basic things, syntax, started to have a lot of mistakes and comments on my PRs and felt insecure in what i'm doing. Turning off cursor tab completely and using chat only in cases where i really need it helped me a lot. I enourage everyone to write code by yourself and use AI only in cases where you are like 80% sure it's going to do what you want and it won't take you much time fxing it's mistakes"<br><br>Criticisms: "Claude accused of bizarre behavior, sycophancy, deleting data, or lacking true engineering rigor; others find Cursor's autocomplete addictive yet risky, or fear engineers will lose understanding of their code."<br><br>Praise: "Fans say Claude + Copilot boosts productivity, helps surface knowledge gaps, and enables complex planning" |
| [Cursor 2.0 Tutorial for Beginners (Full Course)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aldTxnbNt0) | [Riley Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@rileybrownai) | "HOW MUCH ARE YOU BEING PAID TO SHILL THIS FALSEHOOD. This is a lie, from liars. Tell them about the $200 per month fee they will pay just to use a system that will fail them. And if you don't already know how to code, how are you ever going to know, find, or fix any problems with the application? You won't, you will pay to have the computer fix its mistake. Let's now get into bloat, versioning, or full application overview. Codex, Cursor, and Claude are all frauds. Not to mention the only way to train an LLM is with code, and the only code available online is typically bad code with one single true answer, or you have to put bits and pieces together to get it to work. Stack Overflow has millions of wrong answers, and they trained your LLM on every one of them."<br><br>"Skeptics argue Codex/Cursor/Claude generate bloated code that novices cannot debug without real engineering skills."<br><br>Praise: "Several viewers shipped full video-calling or embedded projects in Cursor within days despite limited coding experience." |
| [How I use AI to build startups 10X FASTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFzcL6Ivqz0) | [Marc Lou](https://www.youtube.com/@marclou) | "You are a shovel salesman that sells shovels to naive developers, who think that coding with just AI is the future. Let me break your bubble: LLMs are trained on huge public datasets from the internet and will therefore output the most average code it was trained on. LLMs lack nuance, context and insights that you only get after coding in a real production-grade codebase for at least a couple of years. No wonder your ShipFast repo got pwned a while ago. Did AI not warn you about potential security issues? I doubt it will do it for your current and future projects."<br><br>Criticisms: "LLMs and ShipFast are accused of producing 'average' or insecure code without seasoned engineers in the loop." |
| [800+ hours of Learning Claude Code in 8 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffh9OeJ7yxw) | [Edmund Yong](https://www.youtube.com/@EdmundYong) | Criticisms: "Claude called expensive, rule-breaking, and sometimes unreliable (ignoring constraints, inserting placeholders); some worry Claude dependence harms fundamentals"<br><br>Praise: "Multiple viewers declare Claude decisively better than Cursor, credit it with smoother coding experiences, rapid shipping cadence" |
| [My New AI Coding Workflow To Build Apps Fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsIb_EdhcY8) | [Your Average Tech Bro](https://www.youtube.com/@YourAverageTechBro) | "started using claude code yesterday and my experience is the same as yours... it understands more without providing as much context and makes fewer mistakes. it's actually unreal."<br><br>Praise: "Claude praised for fewer mistakes, model agility, multi-editor support, and architectural awareness" |

Would have taken at least 3-5 hours manually to find the bugs and patch it out. The voice input is a chefs kiss for asking questions on documents/code"<br><br>"So what's working behind the cursor 2.0?"<br><br>Repeating themes: "enthusiasm for automation, multi-agent orchestration, integrated browsers, and voice input" |
| [Cursor AI Just Got a Massive Upgrade Over Claude Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKy71aZHx20) | [AI LABS](https://www.youtube.com/@AILABS) | "You just need one, Cursor and yeah that's it. Auto mode is literally unlimited, and you still have $20 to use if you need to use Claude models or any other without Auto mode. And yes, Auto mode does not consume the $20 credits you have. You can track the usage now by enabling it in settings and put it to always show so you know how much is being used. With Auto mode, the usage is stopped, meaning it is using that unlimited pool and not the $20 credits that you paid for. Auto is also excellent I believe for most tasks it does use high quality models as when switching I actually did not see much difference in quality between both modes. Overall, for a heavy coder like me Cursor is the way to go as the 5-hour limit for Claude code is just not enough."<br><br>"Can you make an updated video showing your full workflow for building an app in Cursor, from 0 to 100%? I'd love to see how you combine all the steps of the BMAD method using the new Cursor features, including how you generate designs, reference rules, or use MCPs to get a clean, working app with minimal errors."<br><br>"Cool, but in Cursor can you: Run the agents in terminal or whatever local UI session (relative to project), and then connect to those sessions and control them from any device?"<br><br>"Until cursor supports Claude Skills like feature, it's not even close." |
| [How I use AI to build startups 10X FASTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFzcL6Ivqz0) | [Marc Lou](https://www.youtube.com/@marclou) | "Cursor + Shipfast is my new go to for building something. I made a little prototype of a SaaS with a friend in 25 minutes the other week! Best of all, it made it fun"<br><br>"Hey Marc, could you please tell us more about the 'browser MCP so Cursor can get the console & network logs'. This would save so much time."<br><br>"Is Composer agent included with the Cursor subscription?"<br><br>Repeating themes: "Cursor pricing/bundled models, MCP/browser integrations, Windsurf vs. Cursor comparisons, workflow shortcuts and rules" |
| [How to Build ACTUALLY Beautiful Apps in 3 Prompts Using Cursor 2.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be5IAxyxa6g) | [Build Great Products](https://www.youtube.com/@buildgreatproducts) | "Can I do this on vscode instead of cursor?"<br><br>"Can you explain why not use v0 to do the same job ?"<br><br>"I'd recommend searching for a Figma plugin that exports the Tailwind implementation or even React code, if You write in React, that you can just give to Cursor/Claude Code to implement around it. Also I recommend Lovart and Google Stitch for designs."<br><br>Repeating themes: "Cursor vs. VS Code/Copilot trade-offs, v0 or Lovable as alternative UI generators, pairing multiple AI models per prompt, and sourcing cleaner design references for LLMs." |
| [Cursor vs Claude Code | The Ultimate Comparison Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSBo9qcpRfw) | [Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/@Codevolution) | "I feel like the better you are at code and development, the better Cursor is than Claude Code"<br><br>"'Claude code builds the house, cursor paints the walls' - Amazing explanation. Deserves a subscribe"<br><br>"I use Claude Code as a pair programmer and I'm a professional SWE, you can also use it for small stuff, there's no need to have claude code implement everything from zero. You can write recipes md files and give it to him to feed on how to create a component for example and pass on clear instructions of what you want to add. If your code base is strongly typed and have a good structure it will usually output a flawless component and you'll save tons of time. It's on another level compared to Cursor/Cline etc. You can also tackle complex troubleshooting all in one tool." |
| [How I use Claude Code (+ my best tips)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7iT5r0Sl_Y) | [Steve (Builder.io)](https://www.youtube.com/@BuilderIO) | "on the 200 max plan I haven't been able to hit opus limits and I'm always running 2-4 terminals. I had a new laptop issues to me at work, so I had claude build a script that would download all the repos I had on my old machine down onto my new machine from gitlab, then in the root directory of my repos I told it to go repo by repo hit the readme and set up every erpos dev evnvironment and run it locally then move on, it was glorious"<br><br>"Use Claude hooks to protect against certain commands example you can run dangerously but also prevent something like a 'rm -f' with a hook"<br><br>Praise: "Claude earns enthusiastic praise for architect-level productivity, bug finding, multi-terminal automation, and plan-mode workflows" |
| [My New AI Coding Workflow To Build Apps Fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsIb_EdhcY8) | [Your Average Tech Bro](https://www.youtube.com/@YourAverageTechBro) | "I grew up with a terminal interface, so I actually prefer it. One suggestion, from experience, make a branch of your your code base, and have Claude Code work with that branch, and then merge changes in when satisfied, it will save headaches later on if it does something wrong."<br><br>"The integration with Jet Brains and VS Code makes Claude Code super versatile."<br><br>"claude code is state of the art. because its based in the terminal. i dont even have vs code installed anymore!" |
| [You've Been Using AI the Hard Way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsQACpcuTkU) | [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) | "Heyy Chuck, how about aider? could it also be used? it is open source, free and allows multiple ai models to be used, local and cloud based."<br><br>"How do the agents you create compare to using Claude Code Skills?"<br><br>Praise: "Omnely, aider, Gemini CLI, and Claude Code get kudos for making AI use '10x faster,' boosting productivity, and supporting developer job hunts" |
| [Sharing My AI-Powered Coding Workflow To Build Apps REALLY Fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvsgCdWss4I) | [Your Average Tech Bro](https://www.youtube.com/@YourAverageTechBro) | "Super good information, would be also very interesting to see an actual demonstration of your workflow with the screenshot + Magic Patterns and how you use cursor+rules+mcp."<br><br>"Awesome, for me it also works to start in bolt before moving to cursor. I've found that bolt is great for the boilerplate UI Layer and I then export the code directly to Cursor and build from there."<br><br>Repeating themes: "workflow requests (screenshots + MCP + rules), cost transparency (subscriptions, Supabase, Magic Pattern), when to reset chats" |

| [Cursor AI Just Got a Massive Upgrade Over Claude Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKy71aZHx20) | [AI LABS](https://www.youtube.com/@AILABS) | "But cursor is just toooooo fucking expensive. They need a max plan for us organisations. I hate that they have a max plan for individuals but no pooling and max plans for teams. PISSES ME OFF!!!"<br><br>"Cursor pricing is $200 per API call. So if you reach your limit in 3 days (weekly) on CC, you will reach your monthly limit in 2 hours."<br><br>"Cursor used to be fine. Now it's just too expensive. And there are many better options. They can't compete with front model makers. It's over for them!" |

This is awesome. Vscode + GitHub copilot license is cheaper than cursor for anyone not wanting to spend on cursor subscription."<br><br>Criticisms: "Cursor pricing locks out some builders" |
| [Cursor vs Claude Code | The Ultimate Comparison Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSBo9qcpRfw) | [Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/@Codevolution) | "Really nice comparison. Been using CC for some months now and it has really changed they way I code. Also, my output is significantly higher than before (x3?). But, CC burns through 'tokens' like crazy. I'm always out of Opus-support by mid day ($100 subscription)."<br><br>"Cursor is a steal."<br><br>"I was actually looking for this kind of comparison, and I've even been thinking of making similar videos myself. Honestly, I feel the same way you explained 😊. Cloude burns way more money, while Cursor is way handier and much more budget-friendly."<br><br>Repeating themes: "billing pain (Claude Max cost, Sonnet pricing)" |

Do you need to buy Claude Ai to be able to use it in cursor? Or is it included into Cursor pricing?"<br><br>"All models that cursor have, are included into cursor pricing"<br><br>Creators worry about "hidden costs, asking whether Composer agents or Claude API usage eat into Cursor quotas." |
| [Cursor AI Full Guide To Vibe Coding Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-HTpN5NGPM) | [Corbin](https://www.youtube.com/@Corbin) | "I wonder what tier of Cursor subscription is used here. I started building (as a noob) and ran up a high usage and tapped out of the free in just two days. Trying to figure out now how to save on usage by getting smarter and using multiple tools more effectively to spread it out"<br><br>"I bloody love you Corbin 🥰 I'm terrified of setting up my App incorrectly and getting a huge bill or draining my bank account."<br><br>Themes: "pricing/usage fears", "subscription tier questions" |
