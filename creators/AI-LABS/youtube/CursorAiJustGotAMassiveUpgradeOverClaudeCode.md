## Comment Analysis

### Common Themes

Commenters fixate on usage limits and pricing pain on both Cursor and Claude Code, with several heavy users sharing how fast they burn through credits and why they're considering switching tools. A second cluster of remarks debates workflow depth: some want full workflow demos or features like Claude Skills, while others argue Cursor’s auto mode, CLI, or IDE flexibility make it more practical for large codebases. The tone swings between excitement about Cursor’s upgrades and skepticism about its cost structure or whether it can surpass agent-style tools.

- **Repeating themes:** subscription caps, requests for full workflow tutorials, comparisons between Cursor auto mode, Claude Skills, Windsurf, Codex, and CLI availability, plus questions about remote sessions and terminal control.
- **Criticisms:** pricing called “too expensive,” accusations of shadiness or shilling, concerns over limited team plans, lack of Claude Skills equivalents, and doubts that Cursor can keep up with native agents.
- **Praise:** fans highlight unlimited auto mode, high-quality edits without credit drawdown, Cursor IDE + CLI flexibility, and its suitability for heavy coders who outgrow Claude Code’s 5-hour window.

| I'm on Claude Code Max plan and reached the new weekly limit in 3 day ($200 for 3 day!!!!!). I'll switch to either codex CLI or Cursor or Kiro... | 2025-10-25 | 5 👍, 13 💬 |
| You just need one, Cursor and yeah that's it. Auto mode is literally unlimited, and you still have $20 to use if you need to use Claude models or any other without Auto mode. And yes, Auto mode does not consume the $20 credits you have. You can track the usage now by enabling it in settings and put it to always show so you know how much is being used. With Auto mode, the usage is stopped, meaning it is using that unlimited pool and not the $20 credits that you paid for. Auto is also excellent I believe for most tasks it does use high quality models as when switching I actually did not see much difference in quality between both modes. Overall, for a heavy coder like me Cursor is the way to go as the 5-hour limit for Claude code is just not enough. | 2025-10-25 | 9 👍, 5 💬 |
| Nobody uses IDEs anymore.  The only reason to go in there is out of curiosity or occasionally to do some code reviews you might not have caught during generation. <br><br>I think the days of Cursor are long gone.  Plenty of first tier options without installing a fork of VS Code.<br><br>Not to mention people don't forget how they were really shady with the way they dealt with their customers.<br><br>Cursor is a hard nope for me and always will be. | 2025-10-25 | 6 👍, 1 💬 |
| Can you make an updated video showing your full workflow for building an app in Cursor, from 0 to 100%? I’d love to see how you combine all the steps of the BMAD method using the new Cursor features, including how you generate designs, reference rules, or use MCPs to get a clean, working app with minimal errors. Basically, a full start-to-finish demo that brings all your workflows together into one polished product, ideally using tools already included with Cursor or free options. | 2025-11-01 | 5 👍 |
| Until cursor supports Claude Skills like feature, it’s not even close. | 2025-10-25 | 4 👍, 1 💬 |
| Cool, but in Cursor can you: Run the agents in terminal or whatever local UI session (relative to project), and then connect to those sessions and control them from any device? I guess you would need to expose the local running server, is all? <br>I have claude setup through a similar SSH+tmux workflow: connect from anywhere and manage it, still relative to same local project, and that's easier because they're already all running within tmux sessions. | 2025-10-25 | 2 👍, 3 💬 |
| But cursor is just toooooo fucking expensive. They need a max plan for us organisations. I hate that they have a max plan for individuals but no pooling and max plans for teams. PISSES ME OFF!!! | 2025-10-25 | 3 👍, 1 💬 |
| Cursor IDE and Prismic CMS the best. | 2025-10-25 | 2 👍, 2 💬 |
| Actually Claude Code in Ghostty with Neovim is goated. | 2025-10-25 | 3 👍 |
| Claude Code is nice, but it's a sandbox, Cursor can be anything you want. The comparison isn't remotely accurate. | 2025-10-25 | 1 👍, 2 💬 |
| When will Cursor CLI come to a stable version and to Windows? #cursorcli | 2025-11-01 | 2 👍 |
| No way, I'm switching from Claude Code to a VS Code fork! Has this channel become a shill for Cursor? I hope not. | 2025-10-25 | 2 👍 |
| Cursor pricing is $200 per API call. So if you reach your limit in 3 days (weekly) on CC, you will reach your monthly limit in 2 hours. | 2025-10-25 | 2 👍 |
| Hello everyone ... I started programming 6 months ago .. Im learning how to build web with ai ... I have chatgpt 25$ version but I want to buy lovable or cursor or any other tool what would you recommend? My budget is only +-25$ .. | 2025-10-25 | 0 👍, 2 💬 |
| I’m still under older 500 requests per month billing on cursor. If you’re using context engineering frameworks like agent os, those 500 requests per month are too good to be true. Compared to usage based billing which is there right now. Just 50-100 messages could fill up your usage quota when using usage based billing | 2025-10-25 | 0 👍, 2 💬 |
| Still for Cursor to make money they need a higher margin than Claude on the API calls that's why they play around with trying to keep context short and not use llms to their full potential, I can't really judge as I haven't used Cursor for a while but I prefer terminal and you are adding one more layer of shadiness to having good consistent performance, so idk.. The features do not look to be above CC features.. | 2025-10-25 | 1 👍 |
| Cursor used to be fine. Now it's just too expensive. And there are many better options. They can't compete with front model makers. It's over for them! | 2025-10-25 | 1 👍 |
| we need an update video for windsurf as well, how much does it compare to cursur | 2025-11-06 | 0 👍 |
| CC lost it's edge, it looks overpriced with the new limits and it got dumber.  Claude responses are terrible, seems like if they did it on purpose, cancelled subscription. | 2025-11-01 | 0 👍 |
