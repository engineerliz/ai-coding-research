| So if I keep using Claude Code, I never been able to tackle technical interview whenever I wanna apply for jobs because the whole time I just vibe coding? Am I the only one who has this thought? | 2025-11-11 | 30 👍, 16 💬 |

| Is Claude better than Cursor | 2025-11-07 | 2 👍, 3 💬 |
| Cursor | 2025-11-01 | 4 👍 |
| I think this video will make me switch from codex to claude | 2025-11-02 | 3 👍 |
| Claude code is very expensive,Cline is better option. please make a video about marketing, i think its the most essential part. I launched my saas a couple of days ago, i got about 60 users but no paying users yet, i did run meta campaigns. | 2025-11-01 | 3 👍 |
| I definitely prefer Claude to ChatGPT. And I DEFINITELY prefer Claude to Copilot. | 2025-11-01 | 0 👍, 3 💬 |
| Thank you very much for the extremely helpful content. I have a question for you by the way. In the video I see you always using the claude code on terminal not using the vscode extension. Is there any special reason for that? | 2025-11-01 | 2 👍 |
| How did you center your terminal like that for the claude window? | 2025-11-14 | 1 👍 |
| Yes, by a landslide. I started with cursor a few months ago…switched to Claude pro then Claude max. Haven’t turned back. | 2025-11-08 | 1 👍 |
| Yes. I switched from cursor to claude. And claude is shipping new features every week. | 2025-11-08 | 1 👍 |
| Yeah, definetly. It doesnt matter if its human or AI coded or even both especially for mobile apps where you can advertise them into the platform to reach more people. I’m an iOS engineer and I do both writing code solo and with Claude, and it really boosts my workflow. I’ve personally made $1237 in the past 2 months with my 2 apps. One fully coded with AI and another one using ai more as an assistant. | 2025-11-07 | 1 👍 |
| ​ @YusufEbr Yes. If nothing else, ChatGPT is extremely agreeable, and is far more likely to indulge whatever prompt you give it rather than respond neutrally. <br><br>The styles of response are also very different. I find Claude sounds much less stilted and robotic, but ChatGPT has an edge is you want something purely analytical. | 2025-11-01 | 1 👍 |
| you can use claude code to learn. its about intention | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| Thoughts on Claude sdk agents vs subagents ? | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| Hey man which one do you think is more worth? Cursor or Claude Code? | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| I added claude code v2 support to the agents repo and made PR. Great work! | 2025-11-14 | 0 👍 |
| Really great video, super useful breakdown of Claude Code tools. I didn’t know about sub-agents and the MCP GitHub resources, which look like real time-savers. Curious how you’re using the new Claude Skills in your workflow, they seem like a game-changer. | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
| yeah, the problem is Claude never respect it's rules. Always breaks it. Hopeless. | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
| Use Claude Code to learn how to code by reading the code it creates to solve LeetCode problems. | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
