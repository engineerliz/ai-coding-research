| I feel like the better you are at code and development, the better Cursor is than Claude Code | 2025-10-15 | 22 👍, 4 💬 |
| Really nice comparison. Been using CC for some months now and it has really changed they way I code. Also, my output is significantly higher than before (x3?). But, CC burns through 'tokens' like crazy. I'm always out of Opus-support by mid day ($100 subscription). I'm planning to look into editor Zed and Warp later on. So many new tools, so little time... Have a good day sir. | 2025-09-15 | 13 👍, 4 💬 |
| The answer is codex with the extension inside of cursor | 2025-09-15 | 6 👍, 1 💬 |
| "Claude code builds the house, cursor paints the walls" - Amazing explanation. Deserves a subscribe | 2025-10-15 | 6 👍 |
| @chrisrollins7413  I get that, but aren't you worried that at some point you will have no idea what your codebase is really doing, and only aware of what your code is spitting out? I feel that Cursor is more of a pair-programmer, whereas Claude Code is an assistant that does everything for you. The latter definitely makes everything easy, just sit back and write prompts, but the former allows you to be in the driver seat incase things need human oversight. | 2025-10-25 | 1 👍 |
| I used both actually, and i can proudly say that windsurf is way far ahead, it's just really smart and do exactly what u ask, no more no less. | 2025-09-15 | 1 👍 |
| ​ @ForxiaPrime  I use Claude Code as a pair programmer and I'm a professional SWE, you can also use it for small stuff, there's no need to have claude code implement everything from zero. You can write recipes md files and give it to him to feed on how to create a component for example and pass on clear instructions of what you want to add. If your code base is strongly typed and have a good structure it will usually output a flawless component and you'll save tons of time. It's on another level compared to Cursor/Cline etc. You can also tackle complex troubleshooting all in one tool. | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
| I disagree, you can get a huge performance boost on Claude Code if you are a good programmer as well using md files to guide the implementation. It is my belief that IDE's should be used as fine grain control while agents build the structure like the excellent quote from the video "Claude code builds the house, cursor paints the walls". Otherwise you'll be losing productivity. | 2025-11-13 | 0 👍 |
| Cursor is a steal. | 2025-11-06 | 0 👍 |
| GPT-5 is about the price of Haiku 4.5........... $1 input /$5 out per million<br>GPT-4.1 and o4-mini ~= Sonnet 4.5.............. $3 / $15<br>GPT-5-Pro and Opus 4.1.................................. $15 / $75<br><br>People sleep on how good sonnet is given a good Claude file and a PRD... | 2025-11-06 | 0 👍 |
| This is a great, to-the-point comparison video. I have used Claude code a bit and wanted to know about Cursor, and this video told me everything I needed to know, thanks! :) | 2025-10-18 | 0 👍 |
| i see you recommend CC overall but is this under the assumption you have coding exerience? when would you recommend cursor over CC? | 2025-10-15 | 0 👍 |
| That was kinda my opinion at first as well. At first my opinion was I'd do all the heavy work myself and let cursor handle all the easier stuff, but the more I vibe code, the more I've started letting AI handle the heavy stuff as well. It's getting so much better and it's just so much faster... But I always go through all the changes the AI makes and almost always tweak things to my coding style before committing them. | 2025-10-15 | 0 👍 |
| use claude for code generation and use cursor for big fixes 🎉 | 2025-10-15 | 0 👍 |
| @Venlorz  it will give your the sonnet model, its not that bad, but yeah if you want best output and piece of mind, go for 100 dollar<br><br>iam using 20 dollar pack, but with some good prompting , iam getting good results. | 2025-10-15 | 0 👍 |
| Can you please do windsurf vs Trae review? | 2025-09-15 | 0 👍 |
| I was actually looking for this kind of comparison, and I’ve even been thinking of making similar videos myself. Honestly, I feel the same way you explained 😊. Cloude burns way more money, while Cursor is way handier and much more budget-friendly. | 2025-09-15 | 0 👍 |
| totally agree as gpt-5 with high reasoning is very comparable with opus 4.1 but a lot cheaper | 2025-09-15 | 0 👍 |
