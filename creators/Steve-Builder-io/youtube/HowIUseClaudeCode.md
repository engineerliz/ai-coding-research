| As a 25+ year dev Claude Code has completely changed the way I code. I know how to create quality code, quality architectures cause I've done them like 40 times at this point.  So now I just guide Claude to create exactly what I want because it can write code at rate that no developer can write code. Not even close. So I find myself as more of an experienced architect now guiding it along. I do have to occasionally step in for very complex things and fix the code for it. But it's pretty rare actually. | 2025-07-15 | 263 👍, 10 💬 |
| Was watching the video up until I heard you say "While it runs a minor risk that it can run a rogue command that's destructive, I've never had it happen." and to suggest doing it anyway is such a disservice to everyone that it tells me you're "vibing" security and that's just a big fucking no. It's ok to do, but not ok to spread around. For those of you using Cursor, instead of "yolo mode" you can whitelist CLI commands specifically without risking to run anything you don't explicitly tell it to. | 2025-08-15 | 27 👍 |
| Not gonna lie, switching back to old sessions using the up arrow saved me a few times. Whenever feedback on my shop shows up through Claude, I capture it via AiCarma for later tweaks. | 2025-11-01 | 20 👍 |
| Really resonates about Claude finding bugs that humans miss, it's wild how AI spots that stuff. All my brand mentions from AI tools pop into ai carma for me these days. | 2025-11-01 | 19 👍 |
| That workaround for the permissions prompts is just what I needed, gets so annoying. For monitoring what Claude and other AIs say about my clients, I let AiCarma run in the background. | 2025-11-01 | 18 👍 |
| 2:02 - You can add a hook to send you a system sound notification just like cursor does whenever Claude needs your input or has completed a task. You can find the info in the documentation | 2025-08-15 | 13 👍, 1 💬 |
| I really appreciate the tip about using clear to manage your token history—makes working with Claude so much smoother. Usually jot down those nugget ideas in aicarma midway through coding too. | 2025-11-01 | 11 👍 |
| Use Claude hooks to protect against certain commands example you can run dangerously but also prevent something like a "rm -f" with a hook | 2025-07-15 | 10 👍 |
| on the 200 max plan I haven't been able to hit opus limits and I'm always running 2-4 terminals<br><br>I had a new laptop issues to me at work, so I had claude build a script that would download all the repos I had on my old machine down onto my new machine from gitlab, then in the root directory of my repos I told it to go repo by repo hit the readme and set up every erpos dev evnvironment and run it locally then move on, it was glorious | 2025-07-15 | 4 👍, 4 💬 |
| No ways i'd just let claude edit files without my intervention 🤣 | 2025-08-15 | 2 👍, 1 💬 |
| Been using Claude Code a lot lately and figured out some tricks that really level it up. I combine it with Genum AI for better prompt structuring and constant validation it helps avoid the random mistakes and speeds up building way more than I expected. | 2025-07-15 | 2 👍, 1 💬 |
| I think my only question is how did you get the Claude-Code extension to appear? the way i have been using claude code on windows is in a wsl terminal. yep fin. but you seem to have a claude code ext. cant seem to initiate that | 2025-07-15 | 1 👍, 2 💬 |
| These are great tips. The main one I'll try is just always clearing when working on something new. I think I've done that a total of 5 times or something like that........ Cheers :) <br><br>Question unrelated to claude: How did you build the edit-mode exactly? <br><br>How are you storing the CSS, as simple css-vars of some kind that live as values in a DB? Curious because that's really cool. | 2025-07-15 | 1 👍, 2 💬 |
| what plan do you recommend? Do you think for casual work $100 plan should be enough? Also what is your opinion on Cursor Pro Plan + Claude Pro ($20) plan together? | 2025-07-15 | 0 👍, 3 💬 |
| What about your own product? Fusion Vs Claude Code? | 2025-07-15 | 1 👍, 1 💬 |
| I get Claude Pro plan, it's so great! | 2025-08-15 | 0 👍, 2 💬 |
| Thanks for sharing, Steve! I tried Claude Code and just couldn't get past a lot of the quirks you mentioned. The most significant issue for me was actually the lack of checkpoints or ability to easily roll back changes (or quickly visualize diffs). I know I could add a commit hook but I don't necessarily want to commit each action.. And when I do voice-to-text it has some visual glitches... The custom slash commands are very cool though. | 2025-08-15 | 0 👍, 2 💬 |
| For data and math heavy programmer claude has a habit of adding placeholder data even when asked not to. Ive had him remove my kelly criterion formula and place it with #kelly criterion goes here. As an example. Its super frustrating because i have arthritis in my hands and claude is great for the boring code.<br><br>It also will fck up asyncs and give you outdated imports. I had to argue with him over the proper web3 version<br><br>I think gemini is better but claude is good with 1 shot debugging and hes more chill and he has a likeable personality 😅 | 2025-07-15 | 0 👍, 2 💬 |
| I have tried and tried with Ctrl + V on windows using wsl Ubuntu in Claude code but it just doesn’t paste images from the clipboard at all 😢. What you mentioned, is it only Mac specific? Know what the windows shortcut would be? | 2025-07-15 | 0 👍, 2 💬 |
| what about the gemini alternative | 2025-07-15 | 0 👍, 2 💬 |
