## Key Findings & Insights

### Topic Threads
Why do users choose to use one AI coding tool over another? 3 main factors seem to primarily contribute to this decision making:

1. **Code Quality (Trust)**: How good is the code generated? Quality of the code, does it work, consistency of the quality
2. **Features/Capabilities (Curiosity)**: What are interesting features that I want to try? Agentic mode, plan mode, web browser are good examples
3. **Pricing (Transparency)**: Users are not penny pinching/price sensitive. They just want to know that the pricing is reasonable compared to competitors. Users are willing to pay a premium for better quality and features.

### Content Style Observations
- **"How to use it" vs "Why I use it" content styles**: Devs don't need a ton of hand holding to onboarding onto AI coding tools (they are already familiar with the base tooling). A stronger narrative is pushing "why" to use the tool.
- **Technical vs Non-Technical Perception**: Technical people seem to call Cursor a "vibe coding" tool, non-technical people call Cursor a "very technical" tool.

### Content Categories
1. **Build in public**
2. **How to use this**
3. **Why I use this**
