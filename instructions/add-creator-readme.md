## Goal
Add a `README.md` in every creator directory under `creators/` that documents key details for that creator.

## Required Sections
1. **Overview**
   - `Name`: the creator’s public or channel name.
   - `Content topics`: short bullet list (or comma-separated list) describing their main themes.
   - `Active social platforms`: bullet list of the platforms where they currently publish (e.g., Youtube, X, Instagram, TikTok). Include only platforms with live accounts.

2. **Social Platforms Table**
   - Provide a Markdown table with columns: `Platform` and `Followers/Subscribers`.
   - Include one row each for Youtube, X, and Instagram.
   - Hyperlink the platform names to the creator’s account URLs (e.g., `[Youtube](https://youtube.com/@handle)`).
   - Populate `Followers/Subscribers` with the latest known counts. If a platform is inactive or unknown, write `N/A` but keep the row.

3. **Notable Content**
   - Bullet list highlighting standout posts or videos specifically about AI-powered coding workflows, tools, or experiments on any active platform.
   - Each bullet should include the platform, title/description with the AI-coding angle, and (if available) a link.

## Format Notes
- Use standard Markdown headings: `## Overview`, `## Social Platforms`, `## Notable Content`.
- Keep descriptions concise (1–2 sentences per bullet).
- Ensure all links are absolute URLs.
